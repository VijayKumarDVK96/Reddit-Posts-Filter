# 🔥 Reddit Post Filter – Browser Extension for Firefox

  

**Reddit Post Filter** is a simple, privacy-friendly Firefox extension that hides Reddit posts containing unwanted keywords. Take control of your Reddit feed by filtering out distractions, spoilers, or topics you're not interested in.


## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add keywords to block posts containing them
- 🧹 Automatically hides posts with blacklisted words
- 📥 Import/export your keyword list as JSON
- 💾 Keywords are stored locally in your browser
- 🔒 No data tracking or analytics


## 🛠️ How to Use

  
1. Click the extension icon in your Firefox toolbar.
2. Enter a keyword in the input box (e.g., "spoilers", "politics").
3. Click **Add** – the keyword is now on your blacklist.
4. Reddit posts containing any blacklisted words will be hidden automatically.
5. Use **Export** to download and make a local backup, since no cloud backup available.
